    <p>Failnet is an collective gathered and dedicated to these morals in which we shall always defend and never stray...</p>
    <ul>
<li>Full and free transparency in information unless it is detrimental to the anonymity of others or ourselves</li>

<li>We will never EVER sell and/or turn over any user data to any agency/company/government body.</li>
<li>We will NEVER endorse or support ANY form racism, sexism, or other discrimination.</li>
<li>We will NEVER endorse, support,  or defend child pornography, pedophilia, or ANY form of child abuse, we do  believe there is a cure and that cure is called .45 ACP. we will always actively pursue pedophiles and hand them over to the law.</li>
<li>WE will never stand or tolerate tyranny, or any unjust government we believe people are free they are not numbers people should not be slaves.</li>
<li>We will always support freedom, free as in free beer.</li>
<li>Everyone is entiled to Privacy</li>
<li>We will always support Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) we will never use any paid or proprietary software.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<p>Anyone who supports these ideas is a member of the community and is welcome. We are not connected in any way shape or form to any other group/company/organization or government. We are run solely by volenteers. </p>
